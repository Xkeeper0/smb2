; ----------------------------------------
;  Super Mario Bros. 2 Disassembly Config
; ----------------------------------------
;
; By default, this repository is set up to build an identical copy
; of the original PRG0 revision of Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA).
;
; You can tweak the build settings below. To remove
; the default options, comment them out.
; (Changing the assignment to 0 won't work.)
;
; To enable them indefinitely, uncomment the definition.
;
; To enable them for a single build from the command line, use
; build -dFLAGNAME
; For example, to build a PRG1/Rev A ROM,
; build -dREV_A

; ----------------------------------------
; Compatibility fixes for the disassembly
; In some locations, Nintendo used absolute addressing instead of
; zero-page for addresses in the zero page.
; This flag adds in raw bytes to match the opcodes,
; as this assembler isn't capable of forcing absolute addressing for zp.
;
; Note that if you use this, you should probably use
; PRESERVE_FREE_SPACE, too.
COMPATIBILITY = 1

; ----------------------------------------
; Preserve unused space.
; Free space in the original ROM will continue to be padded outwards,
; to the extent that it was in the original.
; Adding your own code should shrink the free space afterwards automatically.
;
; Turning this off will "squish" most banks and move free space
; within them to the end, making it easier to add your own code anywhere.
; ...but it might also cause problems if data gets relocated
; when it isn't properly pointed to.
PRESERVE_UNUSED_SPACE = 1

; ----------------------------------------
; Compile CHR Separately
; Instead of as one big block, compiles CHR from a folder of separated
; sprite data.  Optional, but should not affect ROM output.
;

; COMPILE_CHR_SEPARATE = 1

; ----------------------------------------
; Build PRG1 / Revision A ROM.
;
; Differences:
;
; PRG-2-3: Fixes bug where killing one of the mini FryGuy enemies
;          while changing size from taking damage would cause
;          the enemy to do the "flip over and fall off" death
;          instead of the "puff of smoke" death, which caused
;          the "number of small bosses left" number to not
;          decrease. Which meant the boss fight never ended.
;          Hope you had an extra life and a second controller...
;
; PRG-E-F: Fixes a minor issue when played on PAL consoles where
;          remarkably poor luck would cause the bonus chance screen
;          to end up rendering completely invisibly due to an NMI hitting
;          at the worst possible time.
;          The fix just waits for an NMI cycle before doing its work.
;
; REV_A = 1

; CHARACTER_SELECT_AFTER_DEATH = 1

; Restore the prototype's DPCM samples and/or music;
; NOTE: The prototype underground music requires the shortened prototype ending music to fit
